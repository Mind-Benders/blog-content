# September 2024: Key AI Advancements and Strategic Moves

## UAE and Saudi Arabia Advance AI Ambitions with U.S.-Approved Nvidia Chips [^1]
Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia have secured, or are close to securing, access to Nvidia’s advanced AI chips, enabling them to develop high-performance AI models critical to their long-term AI strategies.

Key Points:
- **UAE’s AI Infrastructure**: The UAE secured Nvidia H100 chips for G42, its leading AI company, despite U.S. export restrictions to the Gulf region. G42’s secure data centers played a pivotal role in gaining U.S. approval.
- **Saudi Arabia’s Progress**: Saudi Arabia is optimistic about acquiring Nvidia H200 chips, aligning with its Vision 2030 initiative.
- **Strategic Moves**: G42 severed ties with Chinese companies, investing in secure data centers developed in partnership with Microsoft.

## Nvidia Suffers $279 Billion Loss in One Day [^3]
Nvidia experienced a historic market collapse in September 2024, losing $279 billion in market capitalization in a single day—the largest one-day loss in U.S. stock market history—triggered by a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) antitrust investigation.
